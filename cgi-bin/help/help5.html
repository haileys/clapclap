Reloading.<br>
You know what? There is only 2 ways to win, and if you take the first, you <b>have</b> to reload at least once! You see at the start, you have no bullets so you need them to shoot, and the only way you can get bullets is by reloading. And as I said in <a href="help.cgi?2">The gun</a> each time you shoot, you use up a bullet. And another totally true fact... <b>There is no limit on your bullets!!!!</b> YAY!
