Rebounding!<br>
Yeah! Similar to a shield, this one can actually <b>kill</b> someone! You see, if they shoot and you rebound, they die, and you win! But as well as with the sheild it does not always have an effect (and yes, they can get away with reloading when you rebound) so now you know that, you can take the rebound if you aren't one of those chickens as described in <a href="help.cgi?3">The Sheild</a>.
